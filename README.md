# CIFAR-10-image-classification-using-Convolution-Neural-Network
In this notebook we will show:  Understanding CIFAR-10 data, Use MLP-ANN model to train on CIFAR-10 data and measure its performance and Use CNN model to train on CIFAR-10 data and measure its performance and then compare the same with MLP-ANN
